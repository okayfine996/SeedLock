                <h3>⚠️ Important Warning</h3>
                <p><strong>This app uses AES-256 encryption to protect your cryptocurrency mnemonic phrases.</strong> However, due to circumstances beyond our control—including but not limited to device hardware failure, physical theft, security breaches, vulnerabilities in Apple's iOS system, Apple iCloud/CloudKit service interruptions or data loss, Apple account compromise, unauthorized access, user error, or force majeure events—your mnemonic phrases may be lost, stolen, or compromised. Such losses can result in permanent and irreversible loss of funds. We are not responsible for any losses under any circumstances. Always maintain secure offline backups of your mnemonic phrases.</p>
            </div>

            <h2>1. Acceptance of Terms</h2>
            <p>By downloading, installing, or using Seedlock ("the App"), you agree to be bound by these Terms of Service. If you do not agree to these terms, please do not use the App.</p>

            <h2>2. Description of Service</h2>
            <p>Seedlock is a secure mnemonic phrase management application that allows you to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Store and manage cryptocurrency mnemonic phrases</li>
                <li>Generate BIP-39 compliant mnemonic phrases</li>
                <li>Encrypt data locally on your device</li>
                <li>Optionally sync encrypted data via iCloud</li>
                <li>Create secure backups of your data</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The App operates offline by default. When iCloud sync is enabled, only encrypted data is transmitted via Apple CloudKit. Your mnemonic phrases are encrypted before leaving your device, and we have no access to your data.</p>

            <h2>3. User Responsibilities</h2>
            <p>You are solely responsible for:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Maintaining the security of your device</li>
                <li>Safeguarding your mnemonic phrases</li>
                <li>Creating and maintaining secure backups</li>
                <li>Remembering your backup passwords</li>
                <li>Any actions taken using the App</li>
            </ul>
            <p>We strongly recommend keeping physical backups of your mnemonic phrases in a secure location.</p>
